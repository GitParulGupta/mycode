What is TC ?
TC != time taken to run the program
TC is rate at which time taken inc. w.r.t. input size

TC is calculated as Big O notation

Example: for loop - if loop runs 5 times - at each step - increments and then checks and execute the braces --> then TC is O(15)

Rules -
1. Always compute TC in terms of Worst case scenario
2. avoid constants
3. avoid lower values

Example for point 1:
if(marks <25) print grade 'D'
else if(marks <45) print grade 'C'
else if(marks <65) print grade 'B'
else print 'A'

marks --> 10 check and print --> 2 operations
70 --> 3 checks and then print --> 4 operations

Example for point 2 & 3:

O(4n^3+ 3*n^2+8) lets say n = 10^5
+8 does not have any significance if n is substituted ---> i.e. we dot consider constants

adding 10^15 to 10^10 is of no significane so 10^10 can be ignored

Space Complexity
-- Auxiliar space (space need to solve the problem) + input space (space to store the input)
-- Memory space that the program takes
-- varies from machine to machine
-- Big O notation used

** Never do anything to input unless specifically mentioned its allowed to manipulate the data**

In most interviews 1 second ~ 10^8 operation
